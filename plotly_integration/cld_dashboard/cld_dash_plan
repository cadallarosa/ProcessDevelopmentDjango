# Implementation Summary & Next Steps

## Phase 1: SEC Integration - File Creation Order

### 1. Database Updates (FIRST)
```bash
# Add new models to models.py
- SampleSet
- AnalysisRequest
- AnalysisDataAvailability

# Run migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 2. Core Infrastructure
```
cld_dashboard/
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/common_styles.py          # Create table styles, constants
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/embedded_iframe.py    # Create iframe component
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/url_helpers.py             # Create URL generation helpers
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routing.py                       # Enhanced routing with SEC paths
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dashboard_home.py                # Updated dashboard with SEC stats
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ config/
    â”œâ”€â”€ analysis_types.py                # Define SEC analysis constants
    â””â”€â”€ app_urls.py                      # URLs for embedded apps
```

### 3. Sample Management Updates
```
samples/
â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sample_sets.py                   # Enhanced with SEC request buttons
â””â”€â”€ callbacks/
    â”œâ”€â”€ sample_sets.py                   # Auto-create SampleSet records
    â””â”€â”€ analysis_requests.py             # Handle SEC analysis requests
```

### 4. SEC Integration Core
```
embedded_apps/sec_integration/
â”œâ”€â”€ sec_dashboard.py                     # SEC analysis overview
â”œâ”€â”€ sec_embedder.py                      # Iframe embedding component
â”œâ”€â”€ sec_data_monitor.py                  # Monitor SEC data availability
â””â”€â”€ sec_callbacks.py                    # All SEC-specific callbacks
```

### 5. Main App Update
```
main_app.py                              # Updated entry point with SEC integration
```

## Key Features in Phase 1

### âœ… What Users Will Be Able To Do:

1. **View Sample Sets**
   - Automatically grouped from existing FB samples
   - See SEC analysis status for each set
   - Request SEC analysis for sample sets

2. **SEC Analysis Management**
   - Request SEC analysis for sample sets
   - Monitor status: Requested â†’ Data Available â†’ Report Created
   - Auto-detect when SEC data becomes available

3. **Embedded SEC Reports**
   - Click "View Report" to see SecReportApp2 embedded in dashboard
   - Pre-loaded with correct samples from the sample set
   - Seamless experience within dashboard

4. **SEC Analysis Dashboard**
   - Overview of all SEC analysis requests
   - Status monitoring and bulk operations
   - Direct links to embedded reports

### ðŸ”„ User Workflow:
```
1. User views "Sample Sets" page
2. Sees grouped FB samples with SEC status
3. Clicks "Request SEC Analysis" for a sample set
4. System creates AnalysisRequest record
5. [Later] SEC data is imported (separate process)
6. System auto-detects data availability
7. User sees "Data Available" status
8. User clicks "Create Report"
9. SecReportApp2 opens embedded with pre-selected samples
10. User completes analysis in embedded app
11. System updates status to "Report Created"
12. User can view completed report anytime
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### ðŸŽ¯ Embedding Strategy:
- Use iframe to embed SecReportApp2
- Pass parameters via URL query strings
- Maintain separate Dash apps but seamless UX

### ðŸ“Š Data Flow:
- Dashboard creates AnalysisRequest records
- Background process monitors SampleMetadata for new SEC data
- Updates AnalysisDataAvailability automatically
- Dashboard reflects current status in real-time

### ðŸ”§ URL Structure:
```
/samples/sets                           # Sample sets overview
/analysis/sec                           # SEC analysis dashboard
/analysis/sec/report/123               # Embedded SEC report
/analysis/sec/create-report/456        # Create new SEC report
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1A: Core Setup (Week 1)
- Add new models and run migrations
- Create basic file structure
- Update routing to handle new paths

### Phase 1B: Sample Set Management (Week 2)
- Auto-generate SampleSet records from existing data
- Add analysis request functionality
- Basic status tracking

### Phase 1C: SEC Integration (Week 3)
- Embed SecReportApp2 via iframe
- URL parameter passing
- Status updates after report creation

### Phase 1D: Polish & Testing (Week 4)
- Data availability monitoring
- Error handling
- User experience improvements

## Future Phases

### Phase 2: Additional Analysis Types
- Replicate SEC pattern for Titer, AKTA, etc.
- Each analysis gets its own integration module
- Shared infrastructure for all analysis types

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Bulk operations across sample sets
- Analysis scheduling and automation
- Advanced reporting and analytics

## Questions for You:

1. **Should we start with Phase 1A** (database models and basic structure)?

2. **SEC Data Detection**: How do you want to detect when new SEC data is available? Should we check the existing `SampleMetadata` table for new `result_id` entries?

3. **Report Creation Workflow**: When a user clicks "Create Report" should it:
   - Auto-create a Report record in the database?
   - Just open SecReportApp2 with pre-selected samples?
   - Both?

4. **Sample Set Grouping**: The current grouping is by `(project, sip_number, development_stage)`. Is this correct, or do you want different grouping logic?
